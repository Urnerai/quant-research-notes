# Return Predictability at Daily Frequency

## Research Question

Can daily stock returns be predicted using simple statistical or machine learning models,
or are they mostly indistinguishable from noise?

## Motivation

Many financial ML projects report high accuracy by predicting prices directly
or by using improper validation methods.
This project investigates return predictability using realistic assumptions
and time-aware validation.
