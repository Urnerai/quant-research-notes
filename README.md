# Quant Research Notes

This repository contains my self-study quant research projects focused on
financial time series predictability, proper validation, and realistic modeling
assumptions used in quantitative finance.

## Philosophy

Most financial machine learning models fail not because of poor algorithms,
but because of incorrect problem formulation, data leakage, and unrealistic
evaluation methods.

The goal of this repository is not to "beat the market", but to understand
what can and cannot be predicted in financial time series.
